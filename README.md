# üç∑ Wine Classification App

A Streamlit web application that classifies wine types based on chemical analysis using machine learning.

## Features

- **Interactive UI**: Easy-to-use sliders and input fields for wine chemical properties
- **Real-time Prediction**: Instant classification with confidence scores
- **Robust Model Loading**: Automatically trains model if not found
- **Input Validation**: Warns users about values outside typical ranges
- **Feature Importance**: Shows which chemical properties are most important for classification

## Dataset

Uses the Wine Recognition dataset with 178 wine samples from 3 different cultivars, each with 13 chemical features:

- Alcohol, Malic acid, Ash, Alcalinity of ash, Magnesium
- Total phenols, Flavanoids, Nonflavanoid phenols, Proanthocyanins
- Color intensity, Hue, OD280/OD315 of diluted wines, Proline
